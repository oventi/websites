    <h1>The Porirua Multicultural Council must do better</h1>
    <p>Transparency and integrity are needed for the organisation</p>

    <p class="notice">
        From August 2024 to October 2025, I served on the board of the Porirua Multicultural Council (PMC).
        Despite best efforts I and two other great people and former board members did, it was not possible to 
        break through the toxic culture that continues in the organisation. Delays, lack of transparency, failure of 
        due diligence, poor accountability, unprofessionalism and bullying are regular parts of dealing with PMC. 
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <p>
      There have been several questionable actions done by board members, including by the current 
      leadership, without the members knowledge and I believe it is important to shed light on the 
      past year. PMC's dysfunction, in my opinion, is predominantly caused by wanting to impose the 
      interests of a few and repeatedly disregard PMC's rules to give advantage to those few.

      <b>My hope is that members support a call for full transparency and independent audit of the board's 
        conduct, processes and financial decisions.</b>

      What follows is an account of irregularities I experienced while volunteering there.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>A lost refund on rent</h2>
    <p>
      In December 2024, the board voted to not renew our office lease. I was given the task to notify the 
      landlord, ensure that notice was received, and then bring to the board his response. I did that and 
      the landlord offered to return part of the rent if we left the office earlier. I, along with other 
      board members, helped clear the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PMC leadership delayed in getting this rent back, and when the landlord refused later, I was tasked 
      with writing a draft letter to try to get it back. My letter was presented at a board meeting but then 
      one member of the board said it should not be sent. Once again this was not actioned promptly and we 
      didn't get that money. At the AGM, this fact was omitted from the members. A few thousand were lost that
      could have gone for community projects.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>Attempting to circumvent an employment contract</h2>
    <p>
      When we hired an Admin and Operations support person, I handled the majority of the interview process, 
      and participated in the final decision with other members of the board. After selecting the candidate, 
      I organised a legally binding employment contract, got it signed by the employee and the president, and 
      found a tool to process payroll for the treasurer to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite messages from the treasurer that the payroll process was being handled, and giving reminders 
      of the pay day approaching, when it came to the first pay, it was not done. I learned later from the 
      employee that some board members tried to ask her to send invoices, ignoring the contract. The 
      leadership enabled this and when I tried to raise accountability, leadership saw it as an attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to this inaction and refusal to take accountability, the leadership put PMC in a very risky 
      position, vulnerable to an employment law claim, and the employee was not paid for several weeks. 
      The employee is a young member of our ethnic communities, so this also reflected poorly on the 
      organisation.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>Delays, postponements and not spending funds</h2>
    <p>
      Several board meetings were postponed, actions delayed and requests ignored. The president and 
      other board members could have delegated or asked for help, but they decided rather to wait or 
      leave things to the last minute. Some postponements happened when part of the board wanted accountability 
      and to follow our constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that delay resulted in lack of planning and allocation of funds to projects for the community. 
      We received grants from Wellington Community Fund, Lotteries and Porirua City Council. As of the 
      AGM (2 October 2025), there was around $40,000 not spent. Our communities deserve better and our 
      funders should give money to organisations that follow through with the funding.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>Lack of professionalism in leadership runs</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the above and other issues in managing the organisation, I and two other board members wanted 
      to run for leadership and felt it fair to announce it to the whole board. Our AGM was supposed to be called 
      earlier so we felt it was the time. Right after we notified the whole board, the president sent a reply 
      email accusing us of planning a conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This behaviour was later compounded when, despite 3 board members ready for a board meeting, the president
      unilaterally moved the meeting to a different date. We are all volunteers on the board and the president 
      didn't respect the previously agreed date and time.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>A dishonest election at the AGM</h2>
    <p>
      On 2 October 2025, the PMC held its AGM. During that meeting, a group of members of the board 
      and other members of PMC, performed moves against our constitution. This was enabled by the event 
      facilitator from Multicultural New Zealand. Due to these actions against our governing document, 
      <b>I decided to withdraw my candidacy for leadership and not continue as part of the board. 
      Two other members of the board also stepped down.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
       The voting was not conducted in an organised or fair way. Some non-members tried to vote, 
       and I am not sure if all votes were confirmed as being done only by members. Even when trying to 
       change the constitution, I had to remind the facilitator from Multicultural New Zealand of the threshold 
       needed. I got the impression that despite claims of wanting to follow our constitution, the meeting was 
       there to reward the bad leadership.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h2>What next and how to improve PMC</h2>
    <p>
      The Porirua Multicultural Council has been around since 2018. Unfortunately, in seven years it has 
      not been able to establish good governance processes, organise itself and provide sustainable support 
      to the community. And when dedicated people try to help, we are neglected and put down.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope members, funders and other organisations hold PMC accountable and request an independent 
      review. <b>There are emails and a WhatsApp group that should be made available to members. Those 
      communications show the dysfunctional behaviour of the past year.</b> Multicultural communities 
      need all the support they can and deserve to be supported by organisations that can follow through.
    </p>

        I remain a member of PMC and open to discuss with any other person of my experience. 
        PMC's rules allow for members to request information and hold the board accountable, and 
        I hope other members would want to team up and bring this to a meeting. - Andrés
